# Github Repo Search

This project utilizes React, React Bootstrap, and React Router.

# Next Steps

Future todo items:

- Add tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- Implement state management to track search term and avoid re-fetching of data when possible
- Add pagination to results page with extra fetching so user can see full data set
- Add other client side filtering like date created or owner
